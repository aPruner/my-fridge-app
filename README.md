# MyFridge

A mobile app for keeping track of groceries! Works in co-operation with [MyFridge server](https://github.com/aPruner/my-fridge-server)

## Running the App
1. Run `flutter pub get`
2. Ensure you have an iOS or Android device (or emulator) set up and plugged in (TODO: write more on how to do this)
3. Run `flutter run`
4. Voila! The app should run assuming all went well :)
